This document contains my study notes of the Stanford course \textit{CS103:
Mathematical Foundations of Computing}. I use it for a few purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item As a reference to quickly refresh my memory on the subjects.
  \item Keep the notes to help me understand the text that is not obvious for
    me to comprehend.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Is 0 a natural number?}
% =============================================================================

Is $0$ a natural number? Does $\mathbb{N}$ include $0$?

There is no ``yes'' or ``no'' answer to these questions. Take a look at
\href{https://math.stackexchange.com/q/283/665777}{this question} and you will
find people all over the world have all kinds of understanding such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $0$ is definitely \textbf{NOT} a natural number and does not belong to
    $\mathbb{N}$.
  \item There are two conventions: In one convention, $0$ is not a natural
    number; in another convention, $0$ is a natural number.
  \item Natural numbers include 0; those positive integers are called ``whole
    numbers'':
    \begin{displayquote}
      I see plenty of both these days, but when I was at school and at
      university, I almost only saw them defined to be {0, 1, ..}. The elements
      of {1, 2, ..} were called the whole numbers in my school days.
    \end{displayquote}
  \item Natural numbers don't include 0; whole numbers, denoted as $\mathbb{W}$,
    include $0$.
  \item $\mathbb{N}$ includes 0; $\mathbb{N^+}$ is all the positive integers so
    it doesn't include 0.
  \item yadda yadda yadda...
\end{itemize}

So I don't think it makes sense to argue whether $0$ is a natural number or not.
We just need to define it clearly and move on.

In CS103, $\mathbb{N}$ represents the natural numbers that \textbf{include} $0$.
But if you read 18.100A, you'll see in that course, $\mathbb{N}$ does not
include $0$.

That's fine. The world is still in peace. So in this note, I will respect the
choice of CS103 and treat $\mathbb{N}$ as the set of all the non-negative
integers, i.e., \[\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\].

\section{Introduction to Set Theory}
% =============================================================================

This first lecture introduces set theory. Because I have learned them in MIT
OCW 18.100A Real Analysis, I won't repeat the notes again because they can be
found in the notes for that course. Here, I will just mention a few points that
are not covered in 18.100A.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Set difference: 18.100A uses $A \setminus B$ to denote ``A minus B''.
    CS103 says $A - B$ is also used.
  \item \textbf{Symmetric difference}: $A \bigtriangleup B = (A \setminus B)
    \cup (B \setminus A) = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$. For example, if
    $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A \bigtriangleup B = \{1, 2,
    4, 5\}$. \colorbox{red}{\textcolor{yellow}{TODO:}} Add a Venn diagram.

\section{Cardinality}
% =============================================================================

% ******************************
\subsection{$|\mathbb{N}|$ and $|\mathbb{Z}|$}
% ******************************

I've already learned that $|\mathbb{Z}|$ and the set of all the even (or odd)
numbers have the same cardinality, but in CS103 I just learned $|\mathbb{N}| =
|\mathbb{Z}|$. The bijection (see 18.100A) between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$
is created in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item All the non-negative even numbers (including $0$) in $\mathbb{N}$ are
    matched to one non-negative integers in $\mathbb{Z}$.
  \item All the non-negative odd numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ are matched to one
    negative integers in $\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{itemize}

Visualized, this can be shown as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $0 \longleftrightarrow 0$
  \item $1 \longleftrightarrow -1$
  \item $2 \longleftrightarrow 1$
  \item $3 \longleftrightarrow -2$
  \item $4 \longleftrightarrow 2$
  \item $5 \longleftrightarrow -3$
  \item $6 \longleftrightarrow 3$
  \item $7 \longleftrightarrow -4$
  \item $8 \longleftrightarrow 4$
  \item etc.
\end{itemize}

In general, the bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ is defined as:

\[
  f(n) = \begin{cases}
    n / 2,              & if \ MOD(n) = 0 \\
    (-n - 1) / 2,       & if \ MOD(n) = 1
  \end{cases}
\]

where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

% ******************************
\subsection{Cantor's diagonalization proof}
% ******************************

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument}{Cantor's
diagonalization proof} is used to prove $|S| < |\mathcal{P}(S)|$.

% ******************************
\subsection{$|Programs| < |Problems|$}
% ******************************

This is the most interesting conclusion I've seen in this lecture. The proof
process can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Because every valid computer program is essentially a string, but not
    every string is a valid program, we can see \[|Program| \leq |Strings|\].
  \item The problems in the world may or may not deal with sets of strings.
    Suppose $S$ denotes a set of strings, so one kind of problems is: Given a
    string $s$, determine whether $s \in S$. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Suppose S = \{ ``a'', ``b'', ``c'', $\ldots$, ``z'' \}, then the
        problem can be: Given a string $s$, determine whether $s$ is an English
        letter.
        \item Suppose S = \{ ``0'', ``1'', ``2'', ``3'', $\ldots$ \}, then the
        problem can be: Given a string $s$, determine whether $s$ represents a
        natural number.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Not to mention that other kinds of problems can exist and may not be
    converted to problems that deal with sets of strings.
  \item The conclusion is: $|Sets\ of\ strings| \leq |Problems|$. They could be
    equal, if all the problems can be converted to problems that deal with sets
    of strings.
  \item Therefore:
    \[|Program| \leq |Strings| < |Sets\ of\ strings| \leq |Problems|\]
\end{itemize}
