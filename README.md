# Robin on Math: My Notes of Learning Mathematics

## What is this?

I'm Asian but I'm (super) bad at mathematics.

For all the years before my senior year in college, I feared mathematics, struggled with mathematics, and was anxious about all kinds of mathematical tests. Ironically, my program in college was half math and half computer, so I was forced to study many mathematical subjects. Even more ironically, after being forced to study such much mathematics, in the last year of college (2006), the year I was about to finish my student life, I suddenly started to like mathematics, but I didn't have much time to learn it.

For almost 20 years after graduating from college (I'm writing this `README` file in 2023), I didn't have the courage to pick up mathematics again. But as years passed by, I gradually realized that re-learning mathematics is one of the achievements I want make before I die. I don't want to be "just drifting through the sea of life" ([_Save Me_](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hanson/saveme.html) by [Hanson](https://hanson.net/home)). I want to build my life on top of a solid foundation.

The purpose of re-learning is twofold: 80% for personal interest, and 20% for building a solid foundation for my career as a software developer.

This repository thus serves two purposes as well:
- I use it as a tracker to track my progress of learning.
- I use it to put my notes of learning mathematics.
