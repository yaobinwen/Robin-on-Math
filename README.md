# Robin on Math: My Notes of Learning Mathematics

## What is this?

I'm bad at mathematics.

For all the years before my senior year in college, I feared mathematics, struggled with mathematics, and was anxious about all kinds of mathematical tests. Ironically, my program in college was half math and half computer, so I was forced to study many mathematical subjects. Even more ironically, after being forced to study such much mathematics, in the last year of college (2006), the year I was about to finish my student life, I suddenly started to like mathematics, but I didn't have much time to learn it.

For almost 20 years after graduating from college (I was writing this `README` file in 2023), I didn't have the courage to pick up mathematics again. But as years passed by, I gradually realized that re-learning mathematics is one of the achievements I want make before I die. I don't want to be "just drifting through the sea of life" ([_Save Me_](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hanson/saveme.html) by [Hanson](https://hanson.net/home)). I want to build my life on top of a solid foundation.

The purpose of re-learning is twofold:
- 80% for personal interest.
- 20% for building a solid foundation for my career as a software developer.

This repository thus serves two purposes as well:
- I use it to track my progress of learning.
- I use it to put my learning notes.

## The subjects

For now (2023), I want to learn the following subjects:
- Foundations
  - This part includes several subjects such as:
    - Set theory
    - Proof systems
    - Propositional logic
    - Graph theory
    - Finite automata
    - Turing machine
    - Complexity theory
- Linear algebra
- Real mathematical analysis
  - Side note: I could have just learned calculus but I feel mathematical analysis is more appealing to me.
- Probability and statistics

## Foundations

As I was learning linear algebra and real analysis, I gradually realize I needed to refresh my memory on these fundamental subjects, too. I had learned various such subjects when I was in middle school, high school, or college, but that was two or three decades ago.

As of 2023, I'm (remotely) auditing the Stanford course [CS103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/). This course started on June 26, and today (July 24), the slides for _Finite Automata (Part I)_ were just released, so I am actually learning this course at almost the same time with the students who are physically in Stanford.

## Linear algebra

As of 2023, I'm learning _Linear Algebra Done Right_. The notes (including exercises) are in the sub-directory _Linear-Algebra-Done-Right_.

## Real mathematical analysis

While I'm learning linear algebra by reading a textbook, for real mathematical analysis I want to try a different approach: taking an open course online. I'm currently following the [MIT 18.100A Real Analysis](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/). The notes (including exercises) are in the sub-directory _Real-Analysis-MIT-18100A_.
